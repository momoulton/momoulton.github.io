    <h1>Project Journal</h1>
      <h2>14 July 2015</h2>
      <p>My starting point is Dorothy L. Sayers. Sayers was a novelist, poet, translator, and amateur theologian who lived in the first half of the twentieth century. She's best known for her detective novels featuring the aristocratic sleuth Lord Peter Wimsey. I first enountered Sayers through one of her best-loved novels, <i>Gaudy Night</i> (1935), and I was immediately smitten. In a single densely plotted, atmospheric tale, Sayers touched on many of the key issues of her particular historical moment as well as the universal problem trying to live a good life.</p>
      <p>In short order, I'd read all the Wimsey novels and discovered that Sayers has a core of highly devoted fans. I set out to learn more about her life as well. I'm currently researching Sayers' early adulthood, from when she entered Somerville College, Oxford in 1913 until she met her future husband around 1925. During these period, she was one of the first women to be awarded an Oxford degree; she taught in schools in England and France; she experienced World War I from the home front perspective; she published two volumes of poetry; she settled in London's Bloomsbury and wrote the first two Wimsey novels; she had a series of difficult love affairs and had a child; and she began a stint working as an advertising copywriter. Throughout all of this, she maintained a close correspondence with her parents and a tight network of friends, many of whom were also pursuing artistic careers in the context of immediate postwar London.</p>
<p>I'd like to work on a project that captures some aspects of these elements: Sayers' historical context, her fans, and the larger themes that her novels touch upon. As a historian, it's important to me that the project have a strong historical component: in other words, it needs to go beyond the Wimsey novels themselves. As a reader, it's important to me that project answers some need that readers have and helps to build on the sense of excitement inherent to the novels themselves. I've brainstormed a few ideas.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Social network. This would be a representation of Sayers' social network during these years, including her friends, her professional contacts, her lovers, and her family. It could lead readers to resources on the relationships themselves (for instance, where to find relevant letters) and provide details about the connection, and it could also lead readers to the works produced by Sayers' friends.</li>
  <li>Geography. This might be an element in a larger project: the key locations in this period of Sayers' life. I have her addresses throughout these years, and in at least one case, it seems that a particular address (44 Mecklenburgh Square) house illustrious artists and might have put Sayers in touch with one of her lovers.</li>
  <li>Book recommendations. I love recommending books to people! I think a lot of people discover Sayers' books, but don't necessarily know how to read more, in a satisfying way, into the same time period. </li>
