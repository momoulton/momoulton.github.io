      <p>My starting point is Dorothy L. Sayers. Sayers was a novelist, poet, translator, and amateur theologian who lived in the first half of the twentieth century. She's best known for her detective novels featuring the aristocratic sleuth Lord Peter Wimsey. I first enountered Sayers through one of her best-loved novels, <i>Gaudy Night</i> (1935), and I was immediately smitten. In a single densely plotted, atmospheric tale, Sayers touched on many of the key issues of her particular historical moment as well as the universal problem trying to live a good life.</p>
